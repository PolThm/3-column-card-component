## My process

I first started with HTML then CSS (I first added a "reset.css" file to work with a clean css)
### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I took advantage of this challenge to strengthen and refine my basics and use modern CSS

I learned how to make buttons with transparent text that crosses the background of the button.
And to make grid columns which always remain the same height while keeping the button always at the bottom.
